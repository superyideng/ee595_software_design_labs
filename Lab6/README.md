1. The linear regression part is wrote in LLSR.py and Kmeans part in kmeans.py.
2. In the linear regression part, my w is [-3.89578088  1.19303364]
   Thus the linear regression function is profit_pred = 1.19303364 * population - 3.89578088
   So, when the expected profit in the city of 2 million population is -1.5098, and in the city of 5 million population, the profit is expected to be 2.0694.
3. In the Kmeans part, I generated two output. results.txt are the results generated using the kmeans function written by my self and results_sklearn.txt are generated using kmeans function in sklearn package.
4. As I use python3, please run my code using "$ python3 [filename] [input]" instead of “python”
